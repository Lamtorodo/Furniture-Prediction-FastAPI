## Demo
You can find an explaination of how we proceed to create our endpoint with FastAPI in demo.ipnyb

## Deploiement
Link :https://fastapi-furniture-prediction.herokuapp.com/

## Overview 
This is a FastAPI web app which predicts the price of a furniture .

You can find more details on the dataset in the file furniture.csv.

For this version we choose the Decision Tree Regression to do our prediction after do our pre-processing treatments and comparing many models.

You can see how we work by opening the Furniture prediction notebook.ipynb.ipynb file .

## Installation
